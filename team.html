                <!-- Paragraph Describing the History of the Company -->
                <p>BBQ International's journey began in the heart of Texas back in 1990. Founded by Premsingh Padya, our small family-owned business started with a single mission: to spread the joy of barbecue far and wide. Over the years, we've evolved into a global brand, but our commitment to authentic flavors and quality remains unchanged. From humble beginnings to becoming a household name, every pit, grill, and smoker tells a story of our passion for BBQ.</p>
