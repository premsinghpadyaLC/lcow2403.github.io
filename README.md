CSD 1103 Front-End Web Development I Term Project

**Project Overview:**

In this term project for CSD 1103 Front-End Web Development I, I've meticulously crafted a dynamic website hosted on GitHub's cloud server. With each passing week, I've embraced new challenges and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design. Let's delve into the detailed breakdown of my accomplishments:

**Week 4: Establishing Website on Cloud Server**
With precision, I created the folder structure on the GitHub cloud server, laying down the groundwork for my website's future. Additionally, I uploaded a temporary index.html page, signaling the initiation of my web development journey.

**Week 5: Building a Webpage & Enhancing with Links and Images**
In this pivotal week, I meticulously crafted the index.html, my website's cornerstone. With HTML5 as my canvas, I etched out a sleek structure featuring a captivating header adorned with a company banner image. This header seamlessly integrated a navigation bar, guiding visitors through Home, About, Our Team, and more. The main section greeted visitors with a warm welcome message, complemented by an inviting image. And not to forget the footer, where I left my mark with copyright information and a personal touch.

**Week 6: Applying CSS Styles to Webpages**
Harnessing the power of CSS, I transformed the aesthetics of my website, infusing it with personality and flair. Armed with an external style sheet, aptly named styles.css, I orchestrated a symphony of styles. From setting background colors to customizing fonts and borders, every element received meticulous attention. I experimented with various properties, culminating in a visually stunning and cohesive design.

**Week 7: Specials.html**
Diving into specials.html, I unleashed my creativity, sculpting a page that captivates and entices. Whether it's spotlighting a product of the week or enticing visitors with weekly sales, I curated an experience that leaves a lasting impression. With captivating imagery and compelling content, specials.html serves as a beacon, drawing visitors deeper into the website's narrative.

**Week 8: Responsive Design**
In the age of multi-device browsing, I ensured my website remains accessible and engaging across all platforms. Leveraging media queries and viewport tags, I transformed about.html into a responsive masterpiece. Seamlessly adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports, my website delivers a consistent and immersive experience, regardless of the device.

**Week 10: Improving Web Design with New Page Layouts**
Team.html emerges as a testament to my prowess in HTML5 semantic elements. By incorporating article, aside, section, and figure elements, I crafted a page that not only informs but also captivates. From detailing the company's team structure to narrating its rich history, team.html paints a vivid picture, inviting visitors to become part of the journey.

**Week 11: Creating Tables**
Training.html showcases my proficiency in creating structured data presentation. With a meticulously crafted HTML table, adorned with borders, captions, and alternating row colors, I transformed raw data into a visually appealing and easy-to-digest format. Coupled with CSS styling in training.css, the table exudes professionalism and clarity, exemplifying my dedication to excellence.

With each passing week, I've pushed the boundaries of my creativity and technical expertise, culminating in a website that stands as a testament to my growth and mastery in front-end web development. Powered by innovation and driven by passion, my website sets a new standard in web design excellence.
